### **Current Version: [1.4.0](#changelog)**

## 1. Getting Started

**If you haven't yet set up a React-Native project, do the following:**

First install node and react.

1. `brew install node`
2. `brew install watchman`
3. `npm install -g react-native-cli`

Then, initialize a new project.

1. `react-native init projectname`
2. `cd projectname`
3. `npm install`

**Install the taplytics-react-native package:**

1. Install `taplytics-react-native` npm package:
	* `npm install taplytics-react-native --save`
2. Then link the `taplytics-react-native` native module. (for iOS you will need to manually link the module to your XCode project as described below)
	* `react-native link taplytics-react-native`

## 2. iOS Setup

1. Follow the react-native [manual linking native library instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#manual-linking)
	* project to import is located in `/node_modules/taplytics-react-native/ios/RNTaplyticsReact.xcodeproj`
	* you can skip step 3 of the instructions.

2. Simply follow part 1 of the install instructions to install the Native Taplytics iOS SDK. Use CocoaPods if you use it for your project or the manual install instructions. [iOS SDK installation docs here](https://github.com/taplytics/taplytics-ios-sdk/blob/master/START.md#1-install).

## 3. Android Setup

1. Append the `taplytics-react-native` project `settings.gradle` include line:

	```gradle
	include 'app:', ':taplytics-react-native'
	```

2. add the following line to `settings.gradle`
  	
  	
	```gradle
	project(':taplytics-react-native').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/taplytics-react-native/android')
	```

3. In your app-level `build.gradle` add the following your dependencies:

	```      
	compile project(':taplytics-react-native')
	```
	
	**Note that React Native is packaged with an older version of OkHttp, so an older version of socketio is required:**
	
	```
	debugCompile ('io.socket:socket.io-client:0.8.0') {
        exclude group: 'org.json', module: 'json'
    }
    ```

4. In your app-level `build.gradle`, add this the taplytics url to your repositories:

	```
	repositories {                                                                                              
		maven { url "https://github.com/taplytics/Taplytics-Android-SDK/raw/master/AndroidStudio/" }
	}
	```

5. In your Application Class (default is `MainApplication`), add Taplytics to your app's packages:

	```java
	@Override
	protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
	  return Arrays.asList(
	      new MainReactPackage(),
	      new TaplyticsReactPackage()
	  );
	}
	```

6. **[Follow part 1. Install and part 2. Setup from the Android SDK docs here.](https://github.com/taplytics/taplytics-android-sdk/blob/master/START.md#1-installation)**


## 4. Start making Experiments and sending Push Notifications to your users.

This module wraps most native SDK methods in Javascript, allowing you to access features such as dynamic variables, code blocks and event logging in the React Native environment.

Be sure to import Taplytics into your react application:

```javascript
import Taplytics from 'taplytics-react-native';
```

Then follow the [Experiment](/EXPERIMENTS.md) guide and the [Push Notification](/PUSH.md) guide to get started.
